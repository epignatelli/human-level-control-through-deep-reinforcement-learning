# Human-level-control-through-deep-reinforcement-learning
A jax/stax implementation of the Nature paper: _Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning_ [[1]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236)

- [x] Experience replay
- [x] Target network
- [x] Bellmand error clipping
- [ ] Exploration annealing
- [ ] Consecutive no-ops prevention

 
## Installation
To run the algorithm on a GPU, I suggest to [install](https://github.com/google/jax#pip-installation) the gpu version of `jax`.
You can then install this repo using [Anaconda python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
```sh
conda env create -n dqn
conda activate dqn
pip install git+https://github.com/epignatelli/human-level-control-through-deep-reinforcement-learning
```
